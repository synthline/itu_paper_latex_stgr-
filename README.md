# Intention
Consider this a buffet: Take what you like, combine according to your own needs, and leave the rest behind. 
I am not responsible for the consequences arising from your use of this content. 
This repo has been created with the best intentions to provide:
- Hints on how to perform and report a scientific project, e.g. thesis project 
- LaTeX template
- list of helpful tools and techniques

This repo does NOT claim:
- to provide complete information
- to be suitable for all fields
- to be suitable for everyone
- to replace your scientific supervisor or the contact with him/her

# What is the goal?
What is the goal of your thesis? Perform and report a scientifically solid work in a structured manner, such that other fellow researchers can understand, and reproduce your findings. 
## Examples
You project may include one or several of the following:
- Compare several tools on the same task and compare their performance
- Create a new method to solve a known problem
- Adapt and implement one or several method(s) such that it is tailored to the task at hand
- ...

# Related Work
You will find scientific papers, databases, and interesting tools/methods which you want to use. 
First you need to search what others have done:
- How did they solve/approach your research problem?
- How and with which intent was your considered method/tool used?
- How and with which intent was your considered data used?
It is good practice to use a tool to collect and organize your references, e.g. https://www.zotero.org/

## Literature Review
You must cite the work which you used, and which inspired you. For basic and commonly known methods a book references is fine. 
Credible Sources:
- https://scholar.google.com/
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/
- https://dl.acm.org/
- ...

### ATTENTION
- There are predatory conferences and journals, which claim to be credible, but aren't! 
- On some websites you will not have access to the full papers. However, you will have full access if you are at your university. (You can set up a VPN to have access from home.)

## Data and Code
You must cite the data and code which you used. In case you refer to a website, include date when you accessed it, because websites are due to change. 
To search for available data and code, I recommend the following 
- https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/
- https://www.kaggle.com/
- https://paperswithcode.com/
- github
- ...

# Recommendations
General recommendations for the process. 
## Tools
- try google colab for computations (good if your hardware is very limited)
- use overleaf for Latex (pro: you do not need to set anything up on your own machine, and can write "anywhere")
- forgot the LaTeX symbol? no problem: https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
- need some math help? https://www.wolframalpha.com/

## Time and Project management hints
- use pomodoro technique: https://www.marinaratimer.com/
- define your goals 'SMART': Specific Measurable Achievable Reasonable Time-Bound

# HOW TO REPORT
How do I report my findings? A scientific report conforms to a common structure, which may vary depending on your task and focus. 

## The general structure
Your report should be structured similarly as the following:
- Introduction: intention and related work (the latter can also be separate)
- Methods: Which tools did you use? detailed description of existing methods and your new one (if applicable).
- Data: Which data did you use? How did you collect it?
- Experiments: What did you do? 
- Results/Evaluation: How did it turn out?
- Summary and Conclusion: Did the experiments work our as intented? What did you find? 
- Future Work
- References
- Appendix (not always needed)
Note: There are variations, e.g. often there are no separate sections for experiments and results. 

## What to report? 
Which questions must be answered?
- Report what you did and why, also and especially if the outcome is not positive. 
- How did your method perform compare to others? 
- Reflect on what went wrong and can be improved. Research includes failures.
- If you collected new data: describe how you did it with which intentions. 
- Did you unveil limitations of your data of choice?
- ...

## HOW TO report - hints
- All Figures and Tables must be referenced in the text
- Caption of figures at the bottom
- Caption of tables at the top
- Don't know how to say it? Check this out:  https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/

## DO NOT PLAGIARISE aka credit where credit is due
You may use data, code, images, and even text from others IF and only IF:
- you refer to it properly! (e.g. on github there is often a license agreement and required citations)
- Do not display, distribute, copy data from others without their consent! (GDPR)
